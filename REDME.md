# memory cache example in java core
To implement cache functionality in Java Core without 
using external libraries, existing data structures 
in Java such as HashMap and standard classes can be used.
Here is a simple and practical scenario 
for implementing a cache using Java Core.

## Project scenario :
scenario:
Suppose you have a service for retrieving user information 
from a database and you want to cache the results of these
searches to avoid frequent access to the database.

### Implementation steps:
Define a User class to store user information.
Create a service class that is responsible for retrieving 
user information from the database.
Create a Cache class to manage the cache.
Using the Cache class in service to store search results.
